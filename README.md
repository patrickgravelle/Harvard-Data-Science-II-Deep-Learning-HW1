# Harvard Data Science II HW1

## About

The first assignment of the master's level course "BST 261 - Data Science II" at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, taught by Dr. Heather Mattie.

## Purpose

The goals of this assignment are to 1) become familiar with small neural networks and their structure and 2) to build a neural network to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc  

## Code
